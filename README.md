# SQL SSMS Microsoft
                                                     
                                              Working with SQL in Microsoft SSMS.


In this project, I tried to analyze Covid Death and Vaccination. The dataset i collect from (dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) Our World in Data. And modified the dataset into CovidDeath and CovidVaccination in excel and convert it into CSV format. After importing those CSV files into Microsoft SSMS. Perform queries for analysis of the dataset and form different tables. For better insight, go through the code file in SQL.
